    <h1>Quick intro to REST</h1>

    <p>What is REST?<br>
    REST is a set of conventions for creating APIs which operate over
    HTTP. To put it in simpler terms, REST offers some guidelines on how
    an application and server should interact over the web.</p>
    
    <p>What does REST stand for?<br>
    Good question. REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. An
    API is said to be RESTful, if it follows the REST guidelines.</p>
    
    <p>What does the name even mean?<br>
