    <p>I have a WD My Passport USB HDD, which me and my brother use for our
    backup. Rather than having one for each of us, we use a single HDD (Yes,
    we are cheapskates). As it changes hands between the two of us fairly
    often, we are naturally very concerned about its health.</p>

    <p>I usually use smartmontools to retrieve the SMART data of my HDDs, but
    for some reason, the default set of arguments wonâ€™t do for the WD
    Passport.</p>
