    <h1>Setting up OpenCV with Python 3</h1>
    
    <p>Things change. Half an year ago, I was happy with running OpenCV
    on Python 2. But not anymore. As hard as it is for me to admit, it
    is time to switch to Python 3. So here is my supposedly easy to
    follow tutorial on setting up OpenCV on Python 3.</p>
    
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>First of all, get the latest package listings from the repository.
    If you are on fedora, you can safely skip this. If you are on Debian,
    do the following.</p>
    <p class="code">
		$ sudo apt-get update
	</p>
    
    <p>Lets make sure Python 3 and its dev libs are installed. If on
    Debian, run</p>
    <p class="code">
		$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev
	</p>
	
	<p>If you are on fedora,</p>
    <p class="code">
		$ sudo dnf install python3 python3-devel
	</p>
	
	<p>Now, let us install the python package manager, more commonly
	called pip. On Debian, you would want to do this,</p>
    <p class="code">
		sudo apt-get install python3-pip
	</p>
	
	<p>On fedora, you can do</p>
    <p class="code">
		$ sudo dnf install python3-pip
	</p>
	<p>Now we can proceed to install VirtualEnv.</p>
