    <h1>Git QuickStart</h1>

    <p>This is going to be a short and sweet tutorial to get you up and running
    with git. Git is a version control system. A version control system keeps
    track of file changes. If the current version is not working, we can go
    back to a specific version which worked.</p>

    <p>If you have ever tried to write a program, you will right away recognize
    that having such a system will immensly ease the development process. A
    version control system such as git also saves the day when you are working
    as part of a team. But right now, let us concentrate on getting our feet
    wet :)</p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>If you are on a Debian or Ubuntu derivative</p>
    <p class="code">
    $ sudo apt-get install git
    </p>

    <p>If you are on Fedora/CentOS</p>
    <p class="code">
    $ sudo dnf install git
    </p>

    <h2>Creating GitHub account</h2>
    <p>Now lets create a Github account. Github is a web service which uses the 
    git protocol to allow upload, download and sharing of our projects. It is
    perfectly possible to use Git without Github. But with Github, all of our
    code will be safely backed up and also makes it easy to share our code with
    others.</p>

    <p>Enough lecturing. Go to <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a>
    and create an account. Once that is done, create a new repostory (project).
    A repository is like a directory which contains all the source files of a
    particular project. From now on, we are going to call it a repo. Why? because
    it sounds cool.</p>

    <p>To start working on the repo, we will have to clone it. Cloning means we
    are creating a local copy of the repo on our computer. This can be done by
    clicking on the “Clone or Download” (green) button on the repo page and
    copying the URL to clipboard.</p>

    <p>Now open the terminal, navigate to a directory where you want to store
    the repo and execute</p>
    <p class="code">
    $ cd /home/user<br>
    $ git clone the-copied-url<br>
    </p>

    <p>Once thats done, you will see that we now have a new directory with the
    name of the repo. Lets navigate into the directory and create a README
    file</p>
