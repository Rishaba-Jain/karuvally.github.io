Hi, I am Aswin. Lover of computers, *nix, autos and all things tech. I program, or does some basic I/O, when bored. This is my memory dump for all good people to see :)

# What do you do?
I tweak my Linux box, try to get better at programming, lust at old hardware and cars and spends a good deal of time thinking. I am also trying to earn masters in computer application.

# What programming languages do you use?
Anything that makes me happy :D (Though Python 3 is a favorite)

# Which OS do you use?
Lots and lots of Linux with Windows thrown in occasionaly

# Who designed this blog
The blog was designed by a person called [Micah Cowell](http://blog.micahcowell.com) who was nice enough to publish the template under MIT license...
