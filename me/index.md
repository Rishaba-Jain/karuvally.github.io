Hi, I am Aswin. Lover of computers, *nix, autos and all things tech.
I program, read, teach and does some basic I/O, when bored.
This is my memory dump for all good people to see :)

# What do you do?
I tweak my Linux box, try to get better at programming, lust at old hardware
and cars and spends a good deal of time thinking.
I also try to earn my daily bread by working for a company called XILINX.

# What programming languages do you use?
Anything that makes me happy :D (Though Python 3 and C are favorites) 

# Which OS do you use?
Lots and lots of Linux with Windows thrown in occasionally.

# Who designed this blog
The blog was designed by a person called
[Micah Cowell](http://blog.micahcowell.com) who was nice enough to publish
the template under MIT license...
