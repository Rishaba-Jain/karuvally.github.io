title: My first post!

Okay. here goes my first post. My whole life have been computers till this point. Yes, I do love cars but generally, all the interest gets centered around machines that does stuff. The problem is that lately, I noticed I am not being productive, not doing things that can be considered worthy of mention. Not much coding and creative outputs. Reading does happen, but that has become more of a burden as reading contributes to surplus of thoughts and I don't have a place to dump them.

# Why not use blogger or wordpress?
I want my blog to be lightweight. Not something that will fry the innards of a poor computer. I tried starting a couple of blogs, but ultimately ended up abandoning them. Dont know why, but they did not seem like fun.

# Why Github + Jekyll?
* Complete control of your blog
* Great community with hacker friendly ethos at its core
* Themes made by people who seem to share my thoughts
* It is fun :D

# Conclusion
I am going to do some serious memory dumps here... hope they will keep coming ;)
