title: Remembering IBM PS/2
---

I found an IBM PS/2 ignored inside our computer lab. That is as abrupt as it
gets. I fell for it on the first sight, and emphatically tried pulling my
friends to get their attention. No one couldn't care less. That's when I
decided to do a small writeup about this old piece of machinery.

# History!
It all began with the IBM PC. The advent of micrprocessors made it possible to design computers which were small and cheap to produce. At first, these machines were aimed at hobbyist and enthusiasts who were tired of paying for computer access. But then, people started developing softwares and games for these machines that appealed to normal people, and the market just exploded.

The effect was that, within a couple of years, the microcomputer became a billion dollar industry. IBM was at a significant disadvantage at this point. The computers IBM made were million dollar beasts which only big bussinesses could afford.
