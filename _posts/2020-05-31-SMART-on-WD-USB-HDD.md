title: SMART on WD USB HDDs
---

I have a WD My Passport USB HDD, which me and my brother use for our backup
(rather than having one for each of us, we use a single HDD. Yes, we are
cheapskates). As it changes hands between the two of us fairly often, we
are naturally very concerned about its health.
